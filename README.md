## How To Run the Windows10Debloater.ps1 and the Windows10DebloaterGUI.ps1 files

There are different methods of running the PowerShell script. The methods are as follows:

First Method:

1) Download the .zip file on the main page of the github and extract the .zip file to your desired location
2) Once extracted, open PowerShell (or PowerShell ISE) as an Administrator
3) Enable PowerShell execution
<code>Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Force</code>
4) On the prompt, change to the directory where you extracted the files:
  e.g. - cd c:\temp
5) Next, to run either script, enter in the following:
  e.g. - .\Windows10DebloaterGUI.ps1
  

Second Method:

1) Download the .zip file on the main page of the github and extract the .zip file to your desired location
2) Right click the PowerShell file that you'd like to run and click on "Run With PowerShell"
3) This will allow the script to run without having to do the above steps but Powershell will ask if you're sure you want to run this script.

Remember this script NEEDS to be run as admin in order to function properly.
